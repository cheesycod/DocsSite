import HTTPHeader from "@components/HTTPHeader";

We offer a custom Voting System as a way for users to support their favorite bots.
Users can currently vote for a bot every 12 hours, but this restriction may change in the future.

<HTTPHeader type="POST" path="/bots/BOT_ID/vote" />

> Certified Bots can be found using either the Bot Name or Bot ID. Example below 👇

<HTTPHeader type="POST" path="/bots/infinity/vote" />

# Voting API Rules.

Unacceptable use of our API (breaking these rules will result in appropriate punishments):

1. "Vote locking" a large percentage AND/OR majority of your bots commands AND/OR features.
2. Punishing users of your bot AND/OR community for not voting.
3. Bots should not be rewarding users for voting for another bot. E.g if a User votes for Bot A they should not be receiving Bot B's currency

---

## Acceptable use of our API:
1. Reward users of your bot for voting.
2. Try to limit voting required commands to 2-3

---

## Consequences of breaking these rules:
* First Offence - A stern warning from one of our beautiful moderators and possible reverting of bot votes.
* Second Offence - If you haven't changed your ways after your first offence, or you are caught breaking these rules a second time, we will lock your access to the voting endpoint(s) and reset your votes.
* We reserve the right to not follow these consequences in the exact order they are laid out here and take action how we see fit dependant on the scenario
